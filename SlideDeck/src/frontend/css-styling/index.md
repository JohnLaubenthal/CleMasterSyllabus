## Cascading Style Sheets

- The second front-end language we're going to talk about is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the style layer of the front-end.

- There are multiple ways to identify elements in your HTML and change the way they look.

- There are two methods by which you can style your HTML page with CSS.

- One method is to construct your CSS styling inside <mark>style</mark> tags within your HTML page.

- The second method is to add a seperate styling sheet to your website, then reference that style sheet in your HTML page.

- We will utilize both methods


## External Styling Sheet

- In your Solution Explorer, right click on <mark>SuperDopeWebSite</mark>.

- Select <mark>Add</mark> then <mark>Style Sheet</mark>. Change the name to <mark>style</mark> then select <mark>OK</mark>

    <div float="right" class="img"><img src="./resources/css1.png" /></div>

## We should all be here

- You should now have an <mark>index</mark> and a <mark>style</mark> pages.

    <div float="right" class="img"><img src="./resources/css2.png" /></div>

- Now select the <mark>index</mark> tab.

## Link the style sheet

- Find the file named <mark>style</mark> in your solution explorer, and drag it to the <mark>head</mark> section of the index.html.

- Ensure that the style sheet is the last item referenced in the <mark>head</mark> section.

    <div float="right" class="img"><img src="./resources/css3.png" /></div>

## Selectors

- Before we can apply styles to elements in your HTML, there are 5 main selectors that we need to talk about.

- The first and least specific are **element selectors**. 

- These are just selecting elements by their tag name. 

- Styles will be applied to all elements that have that tag.

- Add the following styling to your style.css file after the closing <mark>body }</mark>

- Select <mark>save all</mark>, select your <mark>index</mark> tab, then select <mark>Google Chrome</mark> from the standard toolbar.

```css
p {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}
```

- Because we are styling by element, all paragraph elements will now have a blue background and white text.

- Question time: Which style command changes the color of the font?

## CSS commands

- There are hundreds of CSS commands we can use to style our HTML.

- Covering all of them would be time consuming and inefficient.

- We have a great resource we can reference whenever we need to find the correct CSS command.

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) Do not be afraid to experiment with as many CSS commands as you can.

## Pseudo Selectors

- Pseudo selectors are the next most specific in our list of selectors. 

- With pseudo selectors we have the ability to select elements by attributes that they have, for example:

```css
input[type="text"] {
    color: red;
}
```
- This is going to give any of our input elements with a type of text a text color of red, but no other input items will be affected. 

- Other pseudo selectors include:

- `:focus`
- `:active`
- `[type="submit"]`

## Class Selectors

- Next on our specificity tour are classes. 

- Classes can be applied to multiple HTML elements 

- Styling rules you apply to your classes will be applied to all elements that have that class. 

If you want to change the font-family of everything in the `.superhero` class to `sans-serif`, it would look like:

```css
.superhero {
    font-family: Euphemia;
}
```
- Look at our elements in our superhero class and notice the change in font type.

## ID Selectors

- The final and most specific selector are IDs. 

- IDs are unique to whatever element they are applied to. 

- Elements with IDs are identified with the `#` symbol. 

- So if you want to style the element that has the `#page-title` ID...

- Add the following code to your style.css file.

- Select save all and refresh your browser.

```css
#page-title {
    color: var(--primary-color); /*We'll get to what this is shortly*/
    font-family: Aharoni;
    font-size: 2rem;
}
```

## Chain Selectors

- Chaining selectors is a way to add more specificity to your selection. 

- For example, if we wanted to keep the changes from our first slide:

```css
p {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}
```

- But we also want any `<h1>` tags inside of our section to have a red background.

- In this case we can chain the selectors to be more specific.

- Add the following code to your style.css file.

- Select save all and refresh your browser.
```css 
section h1 {
    background-color: red;
}
```
- These can also get as complicated as you want them to be, e.g.:

```css
header nav .nav-items li > a:focus {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #123456;
}
```

## Default Styles

- So what happens when we don't declare any CSS rules? 

- Well, each browser has default style rules. 

- It is important to keep these in mind when declaring your own styles because, if you aren't careful, these styles can overwrite and collide with your styles.

- A good first step is to know what the default styles look like. 

- You can check these out using the Chrome's dev tools and disable any link stylesheets. 

- To access the dev tools inside of Chrome: right-click inside of your browser window and click inspect (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `i`).

- An even better step is to knock out all default styles in all browsers with [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

- This is a maintained stylesheet that resets all default styles from all browsers so you start with absolutely no styling happening.

## Colors!

- There are a few different ways to declare colors inside of CSS. Hexadecimal, rgba(), hsla(), and keywords.

```css
h1 {
    background-color: #39ADD1; /*Hexadecimal*/
    border: 3px solid hsla(270, 50%, 45%, 1); /*Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha (opacity)*/
    box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px aquamarine; /*Keyword*/
    color: rgba(0, 255, 127, 0.9); /*Red, Green, Blue, Alpha (opacity)*/
}
```

[Check here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp) for a color checker.

## Units

- There are a lot of different things we need to have measurements for in CSS.

- Some of them static, some dynamic, some relative to the size of the container they're housed in, some relative to the size of the whole window.

### px

- Pixels are a single area of illumination on your screen.

- They are useful but losing popularity as better relative units are becoming available.

### rem

- Rem units are based on the default font-size of the root (HTML in our case).

- So if your root font-size is 16px, 1rem = 16px.

### em

- Em units are based on the font-size of the containing element.

## Units continued...

### Percentage

- Percentage based measurements are based on the size of their parent element, e.g.:

- Add the following code to your style.css file.

- Select save all and refresh your browser.

```css
section {
    width: 300px;
}
section h3 {
    width: 50%; /*This equals 150px*/
}
```

## Units continued...

### Viewport Height (vh), Viewport Width (vw)

- These measurements are based on the size of your viewport (browser window).

- They're similar to percentage that way, except they are always related to the viewport, e.g.:

- Add the following code to your style.css file.

- Select save all and refresh your browser.

```css
ul li img {
    height: 15vh; /*Always 15% the height of the viewport*/
}
```

## Typography

### Font stack

- So a few words on your words:

- You have what is known as a font stack for any given text based element.

- What this means is that you can have a very specific typeface that you want to use but then also have back-ups just in case, for some reason, your typeface isn't available to your user.

- This way you can avoid having to rely on defaults EVER!

```css
p {
    font-family: Cambria, Utopia, "Nimbus Roman No9 L Regular", Times, serif;
}
```

## Typography continued...

### Sans-serif vs. Serif

- Hey, isn't this more design than programming, you ask? Yes! But deal with it. 

- There are some important things to note here as far as screens vs printed material. 

- One of the biggest parts to consider is the size of your text. 

- Serifs tend to be better for things like titles because they're large. 

- The reason this is helpful is because serifs are usually rendered in print media at 1000 dpi and screen media tends to render anywhere from 100-300 dpi. 

- This means large bodies of text tend to do better with sans-serif typefaces. (But rules are always made to be broken ðŸ˜ˆ)

### Monospace, Fantasy, and Cursive typefaces

- DON'T USE THEM.

- Not really never, but seriously, be very cautious using these typefaces.

- They can make your page look disjointed but remember our font stack!

- These fonts, by and large, are less likely to be available to your user than more common serif and sans-serif typefaces.

## Backgrounds

- Most things have backgrounds that can be manipulated and there are three options to choose from: images, colors, and gradients.

### Images

- Images have a much larger range of options to use for the size, position, and repeat of your background.

```css
html { /*items with '||' aren't actually used with that*/
    background-image: url('../images/path-to-my-image.jpg');
    background-repeat: repeat || repeat-x || repeat-y;
    background-size: 300px 200px || cover || length;
    background-position: 50% 50%;
}
```

## Backgrounds continued...

### Color

- This one is much simpler than image by a long shot.

- You just declare a background color and your element will have that color background.

- So if you wanted to make all of your anchor (`<a>`) tags have a yellow background, add the following code to your style.css file.

- Select save all and refresh your browser.

```css
a {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

## Backgrounds continued...

### Gradient

- Gradients are a good way to achieve some really interesting (read: subtle please!) backgrounds for your elements. 

- Hey look at  the background on this slide! So there are two gradient types: **linear** and **radial**.

- Note that you need to use `background-image` for these.

- Add the following code to your style.css file.

- Select save all and refresh your browser.

```css
    body { /*These can get MUCH more complex btw*/
        background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(127, 127, 255, 0.75), #ff6);
    }
    section {
        background-image: radial-gradient(circle at center, red, blue);
    }
```

## CSS Variables

- CSS has built-in variables now which is of HUGE benefit to us. 

- They must be declared in the `:root` element. 

- This is just another way to reference the `html` element. 

- This is a bit of a bonus so don't be upset if this doesn't make sense immediately.

- Add the following code to your style.css file.

- Select save all and restart your browser.

```css
:root { /*Notice we declare this with the same key, value pair.*/
    --primary-color: red;
    --secondary-color: blue;
    --tertiary-color: yellow;
}
h1 { /*Declare variables the same way you would other values.*/
    background-color: var(--tertiary-color);
    color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

Once you finish up, check out what MDN has to offer [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). Use these examples to play around on [Codepen](codepen.io). (also make yourself an account!)
Let's look at [this example](https://codepen.io/donhamiltoniii/pen/JyNjXM) to see power of CSS!
<style type="text/css">
.img:hover  {
        transform: scale(1.5);
        box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    }
</style>
