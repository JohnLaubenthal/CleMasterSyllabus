subtitle: Week-one
theme: league

## Day Two

- Create a Practice problem console application.
- Use proper naming conventions on **Practice problems** as the name of your application
- Code the proper commands to print the following in your console
 
 ```C#
    Cleveland is ranked 12th in U.S. cities for tech job growth
    Ranked 18th in Scaling startups
    Ranked 8th for mid-career professionals 
    3110 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016
   ```
  

## Day Three

- In Visual Studio access Practice problem from yesterday
  - Add the line of output below, using concatenation to make the numbers numerical and not characters in the String
  
    3110 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016
  
  - Refactor your code to reference 2016 as a variable in the output statement
  - Your console should produce what is below
 
 ```C#
    Cleveland is ranked 12th in U.S. cities for tech job growth
    Ranked 18th in Scaling startups
    Ranked 8th for mid-career professionals 
    3110 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016
   ```

## Day Four

What is wrong with this code? Re-write using proper C# convention and syntax?

 ```C#
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
 
  int testnumberone;
  int testnumbertwo;
  
  Console.WriteLine("Enter number 1: ");
  testnumberone = Console.ReadLine();
  Console.write("Enter number 2:");
 
  int sum = testnumberone + testnumbertwo; 
   
   	Console.WriteLine("The sum of the two numbers is 3");
   	
   }

}
   ```
