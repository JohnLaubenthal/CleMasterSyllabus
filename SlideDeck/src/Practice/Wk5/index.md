## Day Two

Write a C# program to detect key presses. You must use switch case to implemenent this solution. If the user pressed number keys( from 0 to 9), the program will display the number that is pressed, otherwise the program will show "Not allowed". 

## Day Three

Write a C# program that allows the user to choose the correct answer of a question. You must use switch case to implement this solution.

See the example below:

What is the correct way to declare a variable to store an integer value in C#?

a. int 1x=10;

b. int x=10;

c. float x=10.0f;

d. string x="10";

Choose the answer letter: c

Incorrect choice!

## Day Four

Write a C# program that prompts the user to input three integer values and find the greatest value of the three values.
