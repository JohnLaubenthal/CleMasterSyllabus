# Database First MVC Tutorial

- [Follow Mel's Step-by-Step Tutorial on Database-First MVC](https://youtu.be/BeZdeWmW-4Q)

## Notes

- In Mel's video, she leaves _Individual User Authentication_ on. You are welcome to leave your authentication at _No Authentication_ or, if you're curious, turn on _Individual User Authentication_. It creates some models, controllers and views that we haven't discussed yet. You choose if you want to look at them.

- When you create the project, use the same type of ASP.NET Web Application that we have been using to create the MVC project.

- When given the prompt to connect to a server, make sure you use your computer name and number (for example, _WECANCODEIT-3_) with \SQLEXPRESS at the end (so _WECANCODEIT-3\SQLEXPRESS_).

- When it gives you the option to choose between _Entity Framework 6.x_ or _Entity Framework 5_, choose 6.x.

- When you add your _ADO.NET Entity Data Model_, you might get a message that says "This may be harmful to your computer". If you do, you can go ahead and add the _Data Model_ without worrying about harming your computer. 

- If you have any questions during watching the video, feel free to reach out to an instructor.
