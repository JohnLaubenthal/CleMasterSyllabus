### - [GitHub Submission Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUEvl_ZgH_OgBu0zbg_WIvB6zBSkkXh7wfxqjv4LwLdBDxLg/viewform)

## Overview
- As a junior devloper, you will construct the following website as per the mockup from a designer.

## Details

- You are working as a front-end developer at a marketing agency. 

- The design team has created a new layout for a client's web site. 

- Their previous website was done several years back, and was not responsive. 

- Not only do they want an attractive site featuring homes, but they want to ensure it is usable on all screen sizes.

- Below, find the mockups from the design team. They have given us a good amount to work with.

- To get the colors right, either choose an online color picker, or download a program (like Gimp) that allows you to choose colors from a picture and tells you their hex values.

- The designers didn't specify fonts for us, but want us to get as close as we can to their design images. 

	- They want to use free fonts, so you thought you could help the team save money by using Google Fonts. https://www.google.com/fonts

    - You are pretty sure these can be included on web pages pretty easily. Also, they are open source / free to use, plus since many sites use Google fonts, some users may already have these cached on their computers, making the page ultimately faster to load than if using a completely custom font.

## Skills Required

-  HTML5
-  CSS Styling
-  CSS Grids

### Stretch Tasks

- Once you've got the basic layout implemented and responsive, it's time to add some pizzazz.

- Find some images of homes, bring them in, and experiment using different CSS techniques.

- Accentuate boxes when the mouse is over them, and/or look into using transitions to make them smoothly animated!

## Hints

- Start with the **structure**, then start to look at the style.

- Before getting too caught up in getting everything pixel perfect, look at how the layout is going to fit the CSS grid system.

- Understand how to implement Flexbox use the site for the different screen sizes.
