### - [GitHub Submission Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUEvl_ZgH_OgBu0zbg_WIvB6zBSkkXh7wfxqjv4LwLdBDxLg/viewform)

## Overview
- As a junior front-end developer at a marketing agency, you have been tasked with constructing the following website as per the mockup from a designer.

### Details

- The design team has created a new layout for a client's web site. 

- Their previous website was done several years back, and was not responsive. 

- Not only do they want an attractive site featuring homes, but they want to ensure it is usable on all screen sizes.

- Below, find the mockups from the design team. They have given us a good amount to work with.

- To get the colors right, either choose an online color picker, or download a program (like Gimp) that allows you to choose colors from a picture and tells you their hex values.

- The designers didn't specify fonts for us, but want us to get as close as we can to their design images. 

	- They want to use free fonts, so you thought you could help the team save money by using Google Fonts. https://www.google.com/fonts

    - You are pretty sure these can be included on web pages easily. Also, they are open source/free to use, and since many sites use Google fonts, some users may already have these cached on their computers making the page ultimately faster to load than if using a custom font.

## Skills Required

In order to deliver this webpage solution, you will need the following skills and knowledge.
-  HTML5
-  CSS Styling
-  CSS Grids

## Tasks

### Project Prerequisites

After you have completed all coding and testing of your application, you will ensure the product owner has access to the application by ensuring the following:
- [ ] Correct GitHub link is properly submitted.
- [ ] GitHub repository created from correct folder and contains solution file.

### User Interface Requirements

During application development process, the following user interface (UI) requirements were identified.
- [ ] HTML5
  - [ ] The base HTML MUST be created in a file called `index.html`.
  - [ ] Semantic elements MUST be used where appropriate.
- [ ] CSS Grid
  - [ ]	CSS Grid MUST be used to create the layout of the web page.
- [ ] Custom CSS
  - [ ] A custom stylesheet MUST be added to incorporate required styling - the use of inline or internal styling is not authorized.

## Stretch Tasks

During application development process, the following application logic requirements were identified. These requirements are not mandatory and are in no way a requirement for delivering the application.
- [ ] The site COULD make use of `:hover` and CSS transitions to be more dynamic.

- [ ] You COULD find some images of homes, bring them in, and experiment using different CSS techniques.

- [ ] Boxes COULD be accentuated when the mouse is over them, and/or COULD use transitions to be smoothly animated.

## Hints

- Start with the **structure**, then start to look at the style.

- Before getting too caught up in getting everything pixel perfect, look at how the layout is going to fit the CSS grid system.

- Understand how to implement Flexbox to use the site for the different screen sizes.
